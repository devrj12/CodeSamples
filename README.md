Some example codes from my Ph.D. research

These are few sample codes from my Dissertation research which focused on analyzing data from Metal Oxide Space Cloud (MOSC) experiment conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory with support from the NASA.

Also included are codes used to analyse data from C/NOFS satellite in-situ observations of the ion density in the ionospheric region of the atmosphere.
